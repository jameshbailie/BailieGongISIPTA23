# BailieGongISIPTA23
This repository contains the supplementary materials for [Bailie &amp; Gong, ISIPTA 2023](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v215/bailie23a.html). `bailie23.Rmd` reproduces all of the figures in Bailie & Gong.

This repository also contains code to reproduce the figures for the follow-up paper [Bailie &amp; Gong, under submission, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15491). `bailie24.R` reproduces all the figures in the follow-up paper. It uses the R package `tikzDevice` to produce TikZ LaTeX code which are then compiled into PDF figures.

`posterBailie23n1.R` reproduces the figure illustrating the Laplace mechanism in the corresponding ISIPTA23 poster. And `posterBailie23n2.R` reproduces the other figures in the poster.
